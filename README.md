# Chicago95-Custom for XUbuntu 16.04 LTS

This is a customized version of the [Chicago95 GTK theme](https://github.com/grassmunk/Chicago95). This is a theme that I've modified for my own purposes and sharing to you. I don't intend to maintain it indefinitely.

#### Requirements

GTK+ 3.18.9

Xfce 4.12

(Preferred distro is Xubuntu 16.04 LTS)

#### Known Issues
GNOME applications such as Disks, Music, Software Store, won't correctly render the outter borders and titlebar.

Thunderbird, FireFox, and potentially other GTK3 applications that I havenâ€™t tested appear to not render menu borders.
